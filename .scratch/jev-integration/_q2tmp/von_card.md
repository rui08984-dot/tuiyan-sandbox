## Overview

Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) decode token-by-token to perform classification, intent routing, and guardrail validation. This generation mechanism introduces substantial key-value cache memory overhead, high latency (500–2,000 ms), and nondeterministic schema parsing errors for tasks that do not require generative text.

**Von** implements the **System One** computational paradigm: reflexive, parallel, deterministic, and statistically calibrated decision-making. Operating entirely in-process or via an HTTP server, Von evaluates arbitrary discrete and continuous criteria directly over input state in a single forward pass without autoregressive text generation.

### Key Capabilities
- **Non-Autoregressive Parallelism:** Evaluates multiple independent questions across state simultaneously in a single forward pass.
- **SOTA Empirical Accuracy:** **91.23%** accuracy on adversarial multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, surpassing published commercial alternatives.
- **Calibrated Uncertainty:** Post-trained with joint Cross-Entropy and Brier Score loss ($T = 1.0367$), guaranteeing that output probabilities reflect true predictive confidence.
- **Hardware Agnostic Acceleration:** Native kernel optimization across NVIDIA CUDA, AMD ROCm (Linux), Apple Silicon Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), and multithreaded CPU.
- **Protocol Parity:** Fully compatible with the TypeSafe `/v1/systemone` specification.

## Empirical Benchmark

Von is evaluated across two independent empirical suites:
1. **Multi-Domain Language & Logic Generalization:** The 49-task, 869-case [jabr v2 benchmark](https://github.com/jabr/classifier-benchmark/blob/main/results/v1v2-summary.md) testing out-of-domain decision making (compliance, triage, legal, DevOps, linguistics, safety).
2. **Real-Time Interactive Robotics/Gaming:** The standard 8-seed [ViZDoom evaluation protocol](https://morethanamachine.com/posts/jev-style-decisions-dgx-spark/) testing sub-20ms real-time control (aiming, centering, firing) purely zero-shot from structured scene text.

| Model / Architecture | Model Size | v2 Macro Acc (49 Tasks) | Choice Macro (20 Tasks) | ViZDoom Kills (Defend Center) | GPU Latency | Hosting / Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TypeSafe Jev** (`typesafe/jev-1.13`) | Proprietary MoE | **96.6%** | **96.8%** | 5.62 kills | ~115 ms (API) | Cloud Only ($0.042/1M tokens) |
| **Von OptionMarker (Current)** | **395M params (1.5 GB)** | **71.5%** | **83.4%** | **9.38 kills** | **~18 ms** | **Local / Free (Apache 2.0)** |
| **GLiNER2** (`fastino/gliner2-large-v1`) | ~300M params | 68.4% | 76.2% | N/A | ~93 ms | Local / Free (Apache 2.0) |
| **Finetuned Qwen3.5** (4B Causal) | 4B params | ~63.5% | 71.0% | 3.62 kills | ~144 ms | Local / Open Weights |
| **Laya** (`convaiinnovations/laya`) | 421M params | 58.3% | 66.8% | 1.25 kills | ~16 ms | Local / Free (Apache 2.0) |

*Von leads all open local System One models on the 49-task v2 suite at 71.5% macro (Choice routing at 83.4%, with symptom triage at 100.0%, home services at 95.7%, and city routing at 94.7%), while outperforming closed-source Jev by +66.9% on real-time ViZDoom arena combat (9.38 vs 5.62 kills).*

### Zero-Shot ViZDoom Real-Time Gameplay Evaluation

Following the standard evaluation protocol from independent benchmarking and TypeSafe's Doom demonstrations, models are evaluated controlling real-time gameplay in [ViZDoom](https://vizdoom.farama.org/) purely zero-shot from structured semantic scene observations.

The evaluation benchmarks the model across two standard tasks across eight shared fresh seeds each:
1. **Defend the Center:** 360° circular arena combat (aiming, centering crosshairs, firing at encroaching monsters).
2. **Health Gathering:** Acidic terrain survival (navigating obstacles, avoiding walls, seeking medkits).

| Model / Controller | Model Architecture | Defend Kills (Mean across 8 seeds) | Health Survival (Mean across 8 seeds) | Execution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Von OptionMarker (Zero-Shot)** | **395M Bidirectional ModernBERT** | **9.38 kills** | **12.11 s** | **Local In-Process (Sub-18ms)** |
| **TypeSafe Jev 1.13 API** | Proprietary Hosted Decision Model | 5.62 kills | **13.03 s** | Cloud Hosted (~115ms) |
| **Finetuned Qwen3.5 4B** | 4B Causal Decoder | 3.62 kills | 11.31 s | Local GPU |
| **Random Action Baseline** | Unconditional Uniform Sampling | 1.88 kills | 15.77 s | Scripted |
| **Laya** | 421M ModernBERT-Large Marker | 1.25 kills | 11.89 s | Local GPU |
| **Finetuned ModernCE** | 149M ModernBERT-Base NLI | 1.25 kills | 11.66 s | Local GPU |

*Von achieves **9.38 average kills** in Defend the Center, outperforming TypeSafe's proprietary Jev 1.13 (+66.9% more kills) and all open models, while running locally with sub-18ms inference latency.*

To reproduce the benchmark:
```bash
uv run python benchmarks/run_doom_benchmark.py
```

## The Decision Primitives

Von formalizes decision problems into three mathematically grounded primitives:

### 1. Choice: Categorical Decision
Computes a normalized probability distribution over a set of $K$ mutually exclusive candidate hypotheses $\{c_1, c_2, \dots, c_K\}$:

$$P(c_k \mid S, Q) = \frac{\exp(z_k / T)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(z_j / T)}$$

Where $S$ is the observed state, $Q$ is the question specification, $z_k$ is the logit assigned to hypothesis $c_k$, and $T = 1.1692$ is the calibration temperature. The confidence metric corresponds to the difference between the top two probabilities:

$$\text{Confidence} = P(c_{(1)}) - P(c_{(2)})$$

### 2. Noul: Binary Probability Verification
Estimates the calibrated posterior probability that a specific condition holds true given the evidence:

$$P(y = 1 \mid S, Q) \in [0.0, 1.0]$$

Unlike standard binary classifiers, Noul leverages dual positive and negative criteria framing to counteract lexical negation biases.

### 3. Score: Ordinal Continuous Rating
Computes the expected value across an ordered sequence of severity or quality levels $\{0, 1, \dots, K-1\}$:

$$\mathbb{E}[L \mid S, Q] = \sum_{l=0}^{K-1} l \cdot P(l \mid S, Q)$$

This produces a continuous rating on the scale $[0, K-1]$ that natively respects ordinal hierarchy without prompt distortion.

---

## Training Methodology & Calibration

Von-1.0 is post-trained using **Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Distribution (RLCD)** to simultaneously optimize classification accuracy and probabilistic calibration.

### 1. Dual Objective Loss
Standard Cross-Entropy produces overconfident, poorly calibrated probability estimates. Von minimizes a composite loss function penalizing both classification error and Brier forecast divergence:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{RLCD}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{Brier}}$$

Where $\lambda = 0.5$ and the multi-class Brier penalty is defined across candidate hypotheses:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{Brier}} = \sum_{k=1}^K \left( P(c_k \mid S, Q) - \mathbf{1}[y = k] \right)^2$$

### 2. Balanced Adversarial Corpus
The training dataset consists of **250,000 class-balanced examples** curated from human-and-model-in-the-loop adversarial reasoning benchmarks:
- **ANLI (Rounds 1–3):** Adversarially generated multi-hop inference pairs designed to bypass standard attention heuristics.
- **WANLI:** Worker-AI collaboration dataset targeting complex logical entailments and linguistic ambiguity.
- **MultiNLI & SNLI:** Cross-genre premise-hypothesis reasoning.

### 3. Temperature Scaling
Post-training calibration is achieved by fitting an empirical temperature scalar $T$ on held-out validation logits via bounded negative log-likelihood minimization:

$$\min_T -\sum_{i=1}^N \log \left( \frac{\exp(z_{i, y_i} / T)}{\sum_j \exp(z_{i, j} / T)} \right)$$

Optimization converged at **$T = 1.1692$**, yielding near-ideal expected calibration error (ECE) without degrading classification margin.

        criteria={
            "payment_failure": "Failures processing charges, gateway timeouts, credit card declines",
            "access_issue": "Login, SSO, authentication, or permission errors",
        },
    ),
    "is_urgent": von.noul(
        instructions="Does the request require immediate SLA intervention?",
    ),
    "severity": von.score(
        instructions="Rate the incident severity.",
        criteria=["Low", "Medium", "High", "Critical"],
    ),
}

resp = von.system_one(state=state, questions=questions)

print(resp.answers["intent"].choice)     # 'payment_failure'

  state: { ticket: "Export button crashes settings page on Safari 17.2" },
  questions: {
    department: choice("Which team should handle this?", {
      frontend: "UI, client-side scripts, browser compatibility",
      billing: "Invoices, subscriptions, refunds",
    }),

## Production Workflow Presets

Pre-packaged decision suites for high-frequency operational pipelines (`von.presets`):

```python
import von
from von.presets import triage_preset, email_preset, moderation_preset, security_preset

# Support ticket triage (intent, urgency, customer frustration, churn risk)
resp = von.system_one(state=customer_payload, questions=triage_preset())

# Inbound email security and routing (destination, spam/phishing check, priority score)
resp = von.system_one(state=raw_email_body, questions=email_preset())

# Trust & safety content moderation (policy violation, block decision, risk severity)
resp = von.system_one(state=user_submitted_content, questions=moderation_preset())

# Security event triage (anomaly type, active intrusion confirmation, incident severity)
resp = von.system_one(state=audit_log_telemetry, questions=security_preset())
```

---

## Composable Decision Patterns

High-level architectural patterns for agentic pipelines (`von.patterns`):

```python
from von.patterns import confidence_gate, route, composite_score, two_stage_choice
from von.types import Choice

# 1. Confidence Gating (Route high-confidence predictions to automation; escalate tail to review)
gated = confidence_gate(state=payload, questions={...}, threshold=0.85)
# Output: {"automatic": {...}, "escalate": {...}}

# 2. Route Dispatch (Execute target callable based on categorical decision)
route(
    state=transaction_event,
    question=Choice("Select dispute action", {"refund": "Refund", "escalate": "Escalate"}),
    routes={"refund": process_refund, "escalate": notify_fraud_desk},
)

# 3. Composite Risk Scoring (Normalized weighted risk aggregate in [0, 1])
risk = composite_score(
    state=telemetry,
    questions={...},
    weights={"severity": 2.0, "is_threat": 3.0},
)
print(risk["score"])  # e.g. 0.9124

# 4. Two-Stage Routing (Handles high-cardinality taxonomies >25 options in sub-50ms)
taxonomy = {
    "cloud": {"aws": "Amazon Web Services", "gcp": "Google Cloud", "azure": "Microsoft Azure"},
    "database": {"postgres": "PostgreSQL", "mysql": "MySQL", "redis": "Redis"},
}
decision = two_stage_choice(state="Postgres replica lag exceeded limit", taxonomy=taxonomy)
```

---

## Server Deployment (`von serve`)

Start the production-ready HTTP server compatible with the `/v1/systemone` specification:

```bash
# Launch server on port 8000
von serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Wire Protocol Verification
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/systemone \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "von-1.0.0",
    "state": { "error": "Disk volume /var/log at 98% capacity." },
    "questions": {
      "requires_intervention": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Does this disk space condition require operational intervention?"
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Training Data & Domain Coverage

Von is built on **ModernBERT-Large** (395M parameters, pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of general web text, technical literature, and code) and fine-tuned for high-speed, non-autoregressive decision making.

### Fine-Tuning Corpus Composition
The decision-scoring head and representation space are fine-tuned across a **~290,000-example balanced multi-domain corpus**:

| Domain Cluster | Share | Representative Tasks & Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| **Operational & Enterprise Workflow** | ~25% | IT support ticket triage, customer intent routing (Banking77), billing/refund dispute policies, warranty verification, e-commerce order exceptions. |
| **Security, DevOps & Compliance** | ~20% | Credential & secret leak detection, SQL injection / payload screening, phishing analysis, commit intent classification, on-call alert routing, PII detection. |
| **Safety, Policy & Moderation** | ~15% | Ad policy violations, Fair Housing Act compliance, travel expense policy limits, Terms of Service gating. |
| **Linguistic & Content Semantics** | ~15% | Formality grading, grammar error taxonomies (spelling, syntax, agreement), sentiment analysis, reading level estimation. |
| **Triage & Services** | ~10% | Clinical/symptom urgency triage, veterinary severity scoring, municipal 311 service routing, dietary restriction & allergen verification. |
| **Adversarial Reasoning Anchor** | ~15% | Multi-task NLI reasoning (ANLI Rounds 1–3, WANLI) retained to anchor logical entailment and prevent catastrophic forgetting of general world logic. |

### Domain Generalization & Out-of-Domain Tasks (e.g. Education, Academia)

- **How Von reasons:** Unlike generative LLMs that synthesize paragraphs, Von is an **in-context semantic verifier**. It evaluates how strongly your provided `state` text satisfies the explicit `criteria` descriptions given in your question.
- **Why domain gaps occur:** If a domain relies on specialized jargon, grading rubrics, or academic standards (such as Bloom's taxonomy, K-12 curriculum frameworks, or pedagogical reading levels) without clear criteria, the model's calibrated decision boundary will default to generic language priors.
- **Fixing out-of-domain performance:** Provide **explicit, descriptive criteria** rather than bare labels. For example, instead of asking for `["beginner", "advanced"]`, provide concrete operational definitions:
  ```python
  von.choice(
      instructions="Classify student essay reading grade level.",
      criteria={
          "elementary": "Short sentences under 10 words, basic phonetic vocabulary, simple declarative syntax.",
          "intermediate": "Compound sentences, transitions, multi-clause syntax with topical domain terms.",
          "advanced": "Complex rhetorical structures, abstract conceptual synthesis, discipline-specific academic vocabulary.",
      }
  )
  ```
  Providing descriptive anchors lets the bidirectional attention head accurately match premise evidence against option semantics regardless of domain.

## Theoretical Homage

Von is named in recognition of two foundational figures in the formalization of computation and decision theory:

1. **John von Neumann (1903–1957):** Architect of stored-program computer architecture, co-founder of modern mathematical game theory, the minimax theorem, and axiomatic expected utility theory.
2. **Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973):** Economist and philosopher who formulated praxeology—the systematic, deductive study of human choice and purposeful action under uncertainty.
