# openjev

One-pass option scoring with a local Gemma 3 4B on Apple silicon via MLX.
Design notes: [docs/design/one-pass-option-scoring.md](docs/design/one-pass-option-scoring.md);
per-task training: [docs/design/per-task-finetuning-with-gemma.md](docs/design/per-task-finetuning-with-gemma.md).

Given a context and a list of pre-written options, the model prefills the
context once, expands that KV cache across the option batch, and scores every
option in a single padded forward pass. No decoding. The score is the
log-probability of the option tokens given the context; a softmax over the
option scores gives a probability per option, like `jevlike-predict`.

## Setup

```sh
make setup       # uv sync (arm64 Python 3.12 venv) + download google/gemma-3-4b-it into models/ (gated; needs HF login)
make serve       # start the HTTP server on :8000
make health      # curl /health
make request     # example curl against /score
make systemone   # TypeSafe-style request against /v1/systemone
make check       # verify cached batched scoring against naive re-encoding
make bench       # latency benchmark
make eval DATA=data/synthetic/test.jsonl
```

`make setup` also installs the optional `torch` extra, used only for the jevlike comparison and HF cross-checks.
`make` on macOS needs the Xcode licence accepted (`sudo xcodebuild -license accept`) or Homebrew's `gmake`.

## Usage

```sh
# Rank options for one context (prints probability, score, raw sum, token count)
.venv/bin/openjev score --context "The capital of France is" \
    --option " Paris" --option " Berlin" --option " Lyon"

# Chat template (context as user turn, options scored as the reply) + PMI normalisation
.venv/bin/openjev score --chat --norm pmi --context "..." --option "..." --option "..."

# Predefined options: one per line in a text file, reused for every context
.venv/bin/openjev score --options-file options.txt --context "..."
.venv/bin/openjev eval contexts.jsonl --fixed-options options.txt   # rows need only {"context": ...}; add "label" for accuracy

# Top-1 / top-3 accuracy on jevlike-style JSONL: {"context": ..., "options": [...], "label": 0}
.venv/bin/openjev eval data.jsonl --norm mean

# Verify the cached batched path against naive re-encoding, and benchmark it
.venv/bin/openjev check
.venv/bin/openjev bench --context-tokens 200 --options 8 --option-tokens 30
```

## Server

Loads the model once and answers scoring requests in about 90 ms each. Runs natively on macOS with
Metal; there is no container path because Linux containers cannot reach the Apple GPU.

```sh
make serve                                     # = .venv/bin/openjev serve --port 8000
curl -s localhost:8000/score -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "context": "Customer: my order arrived broken. Agent:",
  "options": [" I am sorry, I will send a replacement.", " Please read our returns policy."],
  "norm": "mean", "chat": false, "sep": ""
}'
```

The response has `best`, `best_index`, per-option `probability` / `logprob_sum` / `n_tokens`, and `timing`.

## TypeSafe System One contract

`POST /v1/systemone` implements the request/response shape documented at
[docs.typesafe.ai](https://docs.typesafe.ai): a `state` (string, object or array) plus a map of typed
`questions`, answered against that state.

```sh
make systemone     # sends examples/systemone-quickstart.json; or:
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "state": "I ordered size 10 shoes but received size 8. Please send the right size.",
  "model": "jev-latest",
  "questions": {
    "department":  {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Which department handles this?",
                    "criteria": {"returns": "Returns and exchanges", "shipping": "Delivery issues", "billing": "Charges and refunds"}},
    "severity":    {"type": "score",  "instructions": "How severe is the problem?",
                    "criteria": ["minor", "moderate: wrong item", "major: safety or financial loss"]},
    "wants_refund":{"type": "noul",   "instructions": "Is the customer asking for a refund to their card?"}
  }
}'
```

| question `type` | request `criteria` | answer fields |
|---|---|---|
| `choice` | map of option name to description (string, object, array or null); up to 255 options | `choice`, `probabilities` (sum to 1), `confidence` |
| `score` | ordered array of level descriptions | `score` (probability-weighted mean of level index), `probabilities` keyed `"0".."n-1"`, `legend`, `confidence` |
| `noul` | optional `{"true": ..., "false": ...}` | `noul` = probability of yes |

Response: `{"model", "answers": {id: answer}, "usage": {"input_tokens", "output_tokens"}}`.
Set `OPENJEV_API_KEY` before `make serve` to require `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on this route.

How it maps onto the scorer: each question is rendered to a plain-text prompt (state, instructions,
options or levels, then `Answer:` and a newline) and the option names, level numbers, or `yes`/`no`
are scored as continuations in one prefix-shared batched pass per question. `confidence` is 1 minus
the normalised entropy of the distribution; TypeSafe does not publish its formula, so treat it as an
approximation. `usage.output_tokens` counts the candidate-label tokens that were scored.

Comparison on the docs' quick-start request (`examples/systemone-quickstart.json`), Gemma 3 4B
zero-shot vs the numbers TypeSafe publishes for Jev:

| answer | Jev (docs) | openjev / Gemma 3 4B |
|---|---|---|
| `department.choice` | technical, p=0.84, confidence 0.60 | technical, p=1.00, confidence 1.00 |
| `frustration.score` | 1.04 (annoyed but polite) | 2.00 (furious) |
| `is_urgent.noul` | 0.999 | 0.005 |

Same routing decision, but Gemma is over-confident and disagrees on the two judgement calls. Zero-shot
probabilities are softmaxed next-token likelihoods, not calibrated judgements. Closing the gap means
labelled data and a trained head (below).

## Training a head (per-task, on frozen Gemma features)

```sh
make features    # one prefix-shared pass per example, cached to runs/feats/{train,validation,test}.npz
make train       # jevlike's cross-attention head in MLX, listwise cross-entropy -> runs/head.safetensors
make eval-head   # top-1/top-3, ECE, and the shuffled-context control on the test split
```

- `openjev features DATA --out F.npz` stops Gemma before the LM head, keeps every context token's
  final hidden state and the masked-mean of each option's tokens (float16). Options are encoded on
  their own, as in jevlike, so the head has to do the matching. `--contextual` encodes them as
  continuations of the context instead: stronger features, but the match leaks into the option
  vectors and the shuffled-context control below stops meaning anything.
- `openjev train` = AdamW 5e-4 (2e-3 diverges on Gemma features, whose norms are ~115), weight decay 1e-4, grad clip 1.0, 8 epochs, batch 64, best validation
  epoch kept. The checkpoint is `head.safetensors` plus `head.json` (rank, hidden size, training config).
- `openjev eval-head` reports what `jevlike-eval` reports: top-1, top-3, 10-bin expected calibration
  error, and the same metrics with every example paired with another example's context. If the
  shuffled number does not collapse, the head is reading option priors rather than the state.

Result on the synthetic split (2000 train / 400 validation / 400 test, 2026-09-17): features at
77 ms per example, head training 8 epochs in about 15 s.

| | top-1 | top-3 | ECE |
|---|---|---|---|
| head on frozen Gemma features, test | 0.970 | 1.000 | 0.027 |
| same head, shuffled-context control | 0.258 | 0.698 | 0.724 |
| jevlike tiny byte encoder, test | 0.998 | 1.000 | 0.008 |
| Gemma zero-shot, `--norm sum`, test | 1.000 | 1.000 | n/a |

The control sits at chance (about 4.5 options per row), so the head really matches options to the
state, and its ECE of 0.03 is what a calibrated `confidence` looks like.

Python:

```python
from openjev import OptionScorer
s = OptionScorer("models/gemma-3-4b-it", batch_size=8)
for r in s.score("The capital of France is", [" Paris", " Berlin"], norm="mean"):
    print(r.option, r.probability, r.logprob_sum, r.n_tokens)
print(s.last_timing)
```

### Normalisation (`--norm`)

| norm | score | use when |
|---|---|---|
| `mean` (default) | sum of option-token log-probs divided by token count | options differ in length |
| `sum` | total log-prob | options are the same length or you want raw likelihood |
| `pmi` | sum minus the option's unconditional log-prob (BOS-only context) | options differ in base-rate plausibility; costs one extra batched pass |

## Measured on M5 Pro, 64 GB (bf16, mlx-lm)

Workload: 202-token context, 8 options, 242 option tokens total.

| path | median latency |
|---|---|
| context cached once, options batched | 0.17 s |
| context re-encoded per option, no cache | 0.68 s |

Model load is about 1 s from a warm disk. First forward pass adds under a second of warm-up.

## Validating against jevlike

`jevlike` is installed into the same venv (`uv pip install -e ../../vinnylarouge/jevlike`), so both
CLIs read the same JSONL. Generate its synthetic menu set, then score it both ways:

```sh
.venv/bin/jevlike-data synthetic --output data/synthetic
.venv/bin/openjev eval data/synthetic/test.jsonl --norm sum --sep $'\nChoice: '
.venv/bin/jevlike-train data/synthetic/train.jsonl --validation data/synthetic/validation.jsonl \
    --output runs/synthetic-tiny.pt --device mps
.venv/bin/jevlike-eval runs/synthetic-tiny.pt data/synthetic/test.jsonl --device mps
```

Results on the 400-row synthetic test set (2026-09-16):

| scorer | training | top-1 | top-3 | median latency / example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| openjev, Gemma 3 4B zero-shot, `--norm sum` | none | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.086 s |
| openjev, `--norm mean` | none | 0.988 | 1.000 | 0.086 s |
| openjev, `--norm pmi` | none | 0.988 | 1.000 | 0.153 s |
| jevlike tiny byte encoder + head | 2000 rows, 8 epochs | 0.998 | 1.000 | well under 10 ms |

The synthetic task is easy for both. The real validation is your own labelled rows: run
`openjev eval` on them zero-shot and compare against a `jevlike-train`/`jevlike-eval` run on the
same split. If Gemma zero-shot is close to the trained head, Route B is enough; if not, train a head
(Route A) with `make features && make train && make eval-head`.

## Demo: Doom in the terminal

`demo/doom/` runs ViZDoom headless, describes each frame in a line of text, and
lets the server rank the action menu with one `/score` call (or one System One
`choice` question). Start `make serve`, then `make doom`. Details and keys in
[`demo/doom/README.md`](demo/doom/README.md).
