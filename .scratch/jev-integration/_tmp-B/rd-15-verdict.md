**OpenJev (Verdict)** is an open-source, post-trained foundational decision model designed for structured software workflows, inspired by **TypeSafe AI\'s Jev** and **Reinforcement Learning for Calibrated Decisions (RLCD)**. 

Instead of generating free-form conversational text that software must parse and validate, OpenJev accepts unstructured input context and evaluates multiple typed questions in a **single non-autoregressive forward pass**. It returns discrete choices, ordinal scores, and binary probabilities with mathematically calibrated confidence values in under 35 milliseconds.

## What changed in the inference engine

These are inference fixes, not a retrain. The weights are byte-identical to the published checkpoint. Measured on the 231 public JevBench tasks.

</p>

The update addresses three defects in the inference engine:

1. Calibrator auto-loading and removal of the 5-option scope restriction: The engine previously failed to load `calibrator.json` during standalone instantiation, running at uncalibrated temperature 1.0. A scope check also limited calibration exclusively to 5-candidate queries, leaving other cardinalities unscaled. The engine now loads calibrated temperatures automatically and scales across all supported candidate counts.
2. NLI sentence templating for candidate labels: Candidate labels were previously evaluated as bare noun phrases. Because the underlying GLiClass backbone descends from natural language inference (NLI) formulations that expect hypothesis sentences, formatting candidates with hypothesis framing (`It is {description}`) aligns inputs with pretrained representations and lifts accuracy.
3. Context budget cut from 1024 to 512 tokens: The model weights were trained on context states under 71 tokens. Reducing the maximum token budget from 1024 to 512 tokens avoids out-of-distribution positional drift while preserving complete task contexts.

## The core thesis: Jevons\' paradox in software automation

![Why Jev matters](assets/why-jev-matters.jpg)

Most AI automation today relies on conversational Large Language Models (LLMs) generating strings. A software application submits a prompt, waits several seconds for an autoregressive decoder to emit tokens, parses the resulting text or JSON, handles format errors, and branches on the outcome.

This arrangement imposes high latency, high inference cost, and unpredictable parsing failures. In contrast, software workflows typically require a bounded semantic judgment:
- Which department or team owns this support ticket?
- Does this transaction satisfy our fraud threshold?
- What is the primary intent of this customer request?

The model takes its name from William Stanley Jevons, the 19th-century British economist who observed that James Watt\'s more efficient steam engine led to an explosion in total coal consumption. By drastically lowering the cost of mechanical work, steam power expanded into previously unaffordable domains.

### Why single-pass decision readout over generative LLMs?

1. **Sub-35ms Latency**: Generative token loops take hundreds of milliseconds; single-pass bidirectional encoder forward passes take under 35 milliseconds.
2. **0% Schema and JSON Formatting Errors**: Predictions project directly onto pre-declared software types rather than emitting token text, completely preventing JSON parsing failures.
3. **Calibrated Confidence Values**: Probabilities are aligned with empirical accuracy using proper scoring rules, enabling deterministic code to reliably branch autonomously or escalate to human review.
4. **Massive Efficiency Expansion**: When semantic judgment becomes 100 times cheaper and faster, developers embed intelligence directly into internal loops, webhooks, automated tests, and database triggers.

## The four-tier division of labor

Reliable automation splits responsibilities across specialized execution layers:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 1: Deterministic Code                               │
│ State assembly, arithmetic, policy logic, side effects   │
└────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                             │
┌────────────────────────────▼─────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 2: System 1 Decision Model (OpenJev / Verdict)      │
│ Fast semantic categorization, typed choices, probabilities│
└────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                             │
┌────────────────────────────▼─────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 3: Generative LLM                                   │
│ Drafting prose, synthesizing plans, user explanations    │
└────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                             │
┌────────────────────────────▼─────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 4: Human Reviewer                                   │
│ Ambiguous, novel, high-risk, or escalated cases          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Deterministic software remains in control of application state, policy rules, numerical thresholds, arithmetic, and external mutations. The decision model acts as a learned branch operator, evaluating messy inputs and returning calibrated uncertainty. Generative models run only when human-readable prose or complex creative synthesis is required.

## High-leverage production use cases

OpenJev unlocks high-frequency, low-latency workflows previously impossible with token-generating LLMs:

1. **MCP Tool Selection & Subagent Skill Routing**:
   - Modern coding agents spend valuable context tokens and hundreds of milliseconds querying LLMs just to select an MCP tool (e.g. picking between `git_commit`, `search_files`, or `read_logs`). OpenJev evaluates the full tool menu in a single forward pass (< 35ms), returning the exact tool ID and confidence score.
2. **Real-Time Agent Guardrails & Security Triage**:
   - Instead of spinning up a heavyweight LLM subagent to review each step for prompt injections or policy violations, OpenJev acts as a lightning-fast semantic gatekeeper at the perimeter.
3. **High-Frequency State Loops (Robotics & Interactive Simulation)**:
   - Evaluates game/sensor states (e.g. Doom, Starcraft, IoT sensor triggers) and selects discrete actions in real time for pennies per million executions.
4. **Vercel-Style Classification & Ticket Triage**:
   - Replaces conversational models (like Gemini Flash or GPT-4o-mini) on classification pipelines with zero JSON schema parsing errors and 6x faster throughput.

## Architecture and non-autoregressive joint encoding

![How Jev works](assets/how-jev-works.png)

OpenJev uses a bidirectional transformer encoder backbone based on **ModernBERT-base** combined with a **GLiClass** bi-encoder classification head (151,378,177 parameters):

```
Input Document ────────┐
                       ├─► [ Joint Tokenizer ] ─► [ ModernBERT Encoder ] ─► [ Bi-Encoder Head ] ─► Logits
Candidate Labels List ─┘                                                                            │
                                                                                                    ▼
                                                                                             [ Softmax + ECE ]
                                                                                                    │
                                                                                                    ▼
Python Dict Assembly ◄────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Typed JSON
```

1. Document context and candidate labels are concatenated with specialized delimiter tokens (`[TEXT]`, `[LABEL]`).
2. ModernBERT processes all tokens with full bidirectional attention, allowing every document token to attend to every label token.
3. The classification head computes similarity scores between document span representations and label token embeddings in a single forward pass.
4. Softmax normalizes probabilities across the candidate slice.
5. Python memory constructs the structured output dictionary, eliminating JSON syntax errors.

## The functional primitives

OpenJev supports three core query primitives:

### 1. Choice
Selects one label from a declared set of candidate strings (supporting up to 25 candidate slots: 24 substantive + 1 explicit abstention slot).
- **Input**: Shared context string, field description, and list of candidate option strings.
- **Output**: Selected label, probability distribution across all candidates, scalar confidence value, and abstention probability.

### 2. Score
Evaluates the context against an ordered grading rubric or descriptive levels.
- **Input**: Shared context string, rubric description, and ordered levels.
- **Output**: Predicted continuous score or ordinal level, probability distribution, and confidence value.

### 3. Noul
Evaluates a binary proposition (named after the Bernoulli distribution).
- **Input**: Shared context string and a proposition statement.
- **Output**: Probability $P(\\text{true}) \\in [0.0, 1.0]$.

## Solving dependent fields via Topological DAG Execution

A common failure in multi-field classification is the assumption of field independence. OpenJev resolves this using **Topological DAG Execution**:

```
                       ┌──────────────────────┐
                       │  Input Document (C)  │
                       └──────────┬───────────┘
                                  │
                  ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
                  ▼                               ▼
          [ Stage 1: Order Status ]       [ Stage 1: Customer Tier ]
          (Independent parallel pass)     (Independent parallel pass)
                  │                               │
                  └───────────────┬───────────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                     [ Stage 2: Refund Route ]
                     (Conditioned on Order Status + Tier)
```

1. Independent fields execute simultaneously in Stage 1 using a single parallel forward pass.
2. Dependent fields declare prerequisite parent fields in their schema definition.
3. In Stage 2, parent selections append to the context as structured state attributes (`[STATE] order_status=COMPLETED`), and dependent fields evaluate in a second fast forward pass.

## Reinforcement Learning for Calibrated Decisions (RLCD)

OpenJev trains using composite strictly proper scoring rules:

$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}} + 1.0 \\times \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Brier}}$$

where $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Brier}}$ is the multi-class Brier score penalizing squared probability discrepancies across all candidate outcomes. Post-hoc L-BFGS temperature scaling aligns predicted softmax probabilities with empirical accuracy, providing trustworthy confidence gating for autonomous software execution.

Every dynamic schema includes an explicit `__insufficient_evidence__` candidate route, guaranteeing calibrated abstention when inputs are out of distribution or lack necessary context.

## Running the in-browser WebGPU playground

The repository includes a static web playground that executes inference locally in your browser using ONNX Runtime Web and WebWorkers. The model runs on your machine via WebGPU, falling back to WebAssembly when GPU access is unavailable.

1. Navigate to the web demo directory:

```bash
cd webgpu-demo
```

2. Start a local HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

3. Open `http://localhost:8080` in Chrome or a WebGPU-enabled browser.

The playground allows you to edit input text, modify candidate descriptions, remove expected answers to observe abstention behavior, inspect raw probabilities, and export verifiable JSON inference receipts.

## Known boundaries and model limitations

We document the operational boundaries of the current checkpoint openly:

1. Abstention generalisation boundary: While the model achieves 75.50% recall on the standard in-domain missing-option slice, recall collapses to 18.00% when candidates include hard-negative siblings (K=9) and to 23.50% when the abstention prompt is paraphrased to held-out synonyms (10.00% combined). The abstention mechanism depends heavily on the seen prompt structure.
2. Confusable sibling distractors: On random distractors, K=5 accuracy is 96.00%. When distractors are replaced with the nearest semantic siblings, accuracy drops to 94.75% at K=5 and 84.75% at K=9.
3. Abstention precision regression: Retraining with validation NLL model selection increased held-out abstention recall to 97.50% (and missing-option recall to 75.50%), but abstention precision dropped to 89.45% (F1: 93.30%), producing 23 false abstentions on in-scope banking queries.
4. Option order sensitivity: Reversing the option menu flips 3.00% of choices (mean total variation distance: 0.0337). Random permutations flip 4.50%. Flips concentrate almost entirely in low-confidence predictions (mean confidence: 58.9% for flipped versus 93.7% for invariant).
5. Label length correlation: Pearson correlation between token length and selection probability is r = 0.1027, demonstrating that multi-token label lengths do not systematically distort selection probabilities.
6. Near-duplicate contamination: Character 5-gram Jaccard similarity audit found 3 pairs above 0.8 across 2,300,000 train-test pairs, with zero exact matches. Removing contaminated pairs moves accuracy by +0.09% (from 95.00% to 95.09%).
7. Maximum candidate capacity: The classification head produces 25 logits, supporting up to 24 substantive candidates plus one abstention outcome. Passing 26 or more candidates raises a typed `CapacityError`.
8. External comparison floor: On TypeSafe\'s public evaluation benchmark across 337 scored cases, OpenJev achieves 48.07% accuracy compared to 88.43% for 26B DiffusionGemma and 90.80% for TypeSafe Jev.

## Deterministic policy routing

OpenJev outputs calibrated probabilities so that deterministic software rules can decide when to automate and when to escalate:

```python
# Deterministic application policy
THRESHOLD_AUTO = 0.85

decision = result.results[0]

if decision.is_abstention:
    route_to_fallback("Model signaled insufficient evidence")
elif decision.confidence >= THRESHOLD_AUTO:
    dispatch_workflow(action=decision.selected_option_id)
else:
    route_to_human_review(reason="Confidence below automated threshold", score=decision.confidence)
```

At a threshold of 0.85 on our held-out test split, the model achieves 84.60% coverage with a selective risk of 1.18% (10 errors among 846 accepted predictions).
