# Jev-style decisions on a laptop

**Unofficial research repo. Not affiliated with TypeSafe AI.** This is a hands-on study of the *parallel constrained decoding* idea behind [Jev](https://typesafe.ai/) — the "System One" model launched by Diogo Almeida's TypeSafe AI in Sep 2026 — reproduced on a stock, untrained small model, on an Apple Silicon laptop.

The trick: instead of generating JSON token-by-token, define your schema as a set of typed fields, prefill the context **once**, broadcast the KV cache across one batch row per field, and evaluate **all fields in a single forward pass**. JSON is assembled programmatically, so it can never be malformed. The interesting claim: **a 1.5B model that cannot reliably write 28-field JSON can still make 28 schema-valid decisions in ~0.4 s.**

```
[context + schema] ──► prefill (once) ──► KV cache
                                            │ broadcast ×N fields
      ┌───────────┬───────────┬─────────────┴───────────┐
    field 1     field 2     ...                      field N
      └───────────┴──── one batched forward pass ────────┘
                          │
              slice logits → softmax → pick value + probability
```

Engine: [`harshatheg/Qwen-2.5-1B-RLCD`](https://huggingface.co/harshatheg/Qwen-2.5-1B-RLCD) (Apache-2.0, cloned at setup, **not** vendored here). We wrote our own runner, benchmarked three model sizes on a 16 GB M5 MacBook Air, and documented what's real vs. marketing.

## Quickstart (Apple Silicon Mac)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rorshopping/jev-on-a-laptop
cd jev-on-a-laptop
./setup.sh          # creates .venv, installs mlx-lm, clones the upstream engine
./run_benchmark.sh  # default: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-4bit
```

**Windows / NVIDIA GPU:** use the released `parallel-decisions` library's
[GPU setup and performance guide](https://github.com/rorshopping/parallel-decisions/blob/main/GPU_SETUP.md)
for installation, configuration and reproducible benchmarks. Our integrated Torch
backend supports shared-prefix reuse and optional CUDA Graphs. On separate warmed
0.5B workloads, graphs reduced request latency **60.1 → 51.8 ms** (8 fields) and
**240.9 → 83.8 ms** (custom 27 fields). Capture needs free VRAM and may fall back
to eager; these are not browser-click timings or universal gains. See
[doc 14](docs/14-gpu-torch-backend.md) for evidence and limitations, and
[doc 07](docs/07-hardware-mac-vs-pc-analysis.md) for the memory analysis.

**See it without installing anything:** a static showcase with real recorded outputs is live at
**[huggingface.co/spaces/rorshopping/parallel-constrained-decisions](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rorshopping/parallel-constrained-decisions)**
(source in `hf-space-static/`). Its interactive sibling — a Gradio app that runs live on ZeroGPU — is
ready in `hf-space/`; deploying it requires a Hugging Face **PRO** account (free accounts can't host
Gradio Spaces; static Spaces are free). One command when you have PRO: `python hf-space/push_to_hub.py`.

Try a single decision instead:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/demo.py                          # fintech fraud preset
.venv/bin/python tools/demo.py support_triage --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-4bit
```

Sample output:

```
field                  value               conf
---------------------  ------------------  -----
is_fraudulent          True                0.999
risk_tier              CRITICAL            0.997
recommended_action     FREEZE_ACCOUNT      0.982
...
```

## Measured results (M5 MacBook Air, 16 GB)

28-field fraud preset. "Naive" = the same model writing the whole JSON object token-by-token.

| Model (4-bit) | Naive JSON | Parallel decisions | Speedup | Naive schema-valid? | Parallel schema-valid? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | 3.3 s | **0.41 s** | 7.9x | ❌ | ✅ |
| Qwen2.5-7B | 11.9 s | **1.52 s** | 7.9x | ❌ | ✅ |
| Qwen3-8B | 14.3 s | **2.03 s** | 7.0x | ❌ | ✅ |

Also measured: 4-field / 255-choice tariff preset (1.5B: 0.15 s, 5.9x) and support-triage (1.5B: 0.76 s, 4.4x — collision handling costs extra). Full logs and JSON: `results/`.

**Punchline: none of the three models could reliably emit 28-field JSON unconstrained — all three are always schema-valid through the constrained path.** Model size does not fix JSON reliability; the decoding structure does.

## Is a bigger model worth it? (measured)

24 labeled cases × 3 fields = 72 decisions per model, run through the same engine (`quality-eval/`):

| Model | Primary field acc | All fields exact | Latency/case |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.5B | 58% (= majority-class baseline 54%) | 50% | 147 ms |
| **7B** | **96%** | 72% | 611 ms |
| **8B** | 92% | **85%** | 646 ms |

**Verdict:** yes, 1.5B→7B is a clear win (+37 pts primary accuracy); 1.5B is only suitable for demos/UI work. 7B is the best when the single primary decision is what you act on; 8B is best when *all* fields must be jointly correct, at nearly the same speed. Also measured: **confidence does not reliably flag errors** — the 7B was >0.90 confident on 13 of its 20 wrong fields. Full report: `quality-eval/SUMMARY.md`.

## What's real vs. what's marketing (in our measurements)

| Claim | Verdict here |
|---|---|
| Typed outputs, no string generation | ✅ by construction |
| 100% schema validity | ✅ keys/enums guaranteed; values can still be *wrong* |
| One pass for all fields | ✅ common case; fields whose choices share a first token hit a slow fallback |
| "Calibrated" confidence | ❌ raw softmax over candidate logits — a proxy, not trained calibration |
| 40–200x faster | N/A for local; vs. its own naive baseline we measured **3.4–7.9x** |
| Runs on a laptop | ✅ this exact repo |

## How does this compare to Jev itself?

TypeSafe's own workflow evals (https://evals.typesafe.ai/) put Jev at **67.8% mean accuracy** (61.7–76.0% per workflow) against a **frontier consensus** (average of GPT-6 Astra and Fable 5.1 answering every question), at $0.0004 and 0.4 s per case. Our 8B's 84.7%/91.7% is **not comparable** (rule-constructed labels, synthetic cases, n=24) — it would imply beating Opus 5 (73.1%) and Sol (74.1%) on their eval, which is implausible. Comparable findings: same-order latency (0.4 s vs 0.65 s) and a ~100–1000x local cost advantage, both type-safe by construction. Full analysis in `docs/10-jev-published-accuracy-vs-our-8b.md`.

## 5. Head-to-head on TypeSafe's own questions (full public eval)

We rebuilt **all public example cases of all four TypeSafe workflows** — 20 cases, **373 reference question-pairs** — and scored everyone against TypeSafe's own reference (consensus of GPT-6 Astra + Fable 5.1). Full detail: `evals/RESULTS.md` and `docs/12-full-head-to-head.md`.

Strict like-for-like — the 343 pairs answered by every model:

| Model | Agreement | Pairs |
|---|---|---|
| Opus (published) | 89.8% | 308/343 |
| DeepSeek v4.1 Flash (max) | 89.5% | 307/343 |
| Sol (published) | 89.2% | 306/343 |
| **Jev / TypeSafe (published)** | **86.6%** | **297/343** |
| **local Qwen2.5-7B (free, on an M5 Air)** | **73.8%** | **253/343** |
| local Qwen3-8B (3 of 4 workflows) | 71.2% | 114/160 |

**The honest result: the free local model is ~13 points behind Jev on Jev's own benchmark.** An earlier 5-case run (`docs/11-...`) showed a tie, but that was an artifact of the tiny curated sample — on the full public set the gap is real and stable across all four workflows. The local model's advantages are cost (~$0), privacy, and offline operation, not accuracy parity. The frontier cluster sits at 86–90%; Jev at 86.6% is genuinely in that cluster at 1/1000th the price.
