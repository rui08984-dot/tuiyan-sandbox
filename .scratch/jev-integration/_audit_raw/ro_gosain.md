# jev-sec-bench

Blind security benchmarks for [Jev](https://typesafe.ai), TypeSafe's System One
model, built on [jev-go](https://github.com/Gaurav-Gosain/jev-go).

Jev does not generate text. It reads a state and returns typed judgments with
calibrated probabilities, which is the shape a guardrail actually needs: a number
your code can threshold, not a paragraph you have to parse.

Two benchmarks, both blind, both on public corpora:

- **prompt injection**, on all 662 labelled messages in `deepset/prompt-injections`
- **vulnerable code**, on 200 matched pairs from `CyberNative/Code_Vulnerability_Security_DPO`

```bash
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
go run ./cmd/jev-sec-bench -bench all   # run the benchmarks
go run ./cmd/jev-tui                    # read the results back as a dashboard
```

Run on 2026-09-16 against `jev-1.13.0`. Raw per sample output is in [`results/`](results/).

## Prompt injection

662 messages, 263 of them injections, one request each. No threshold tuning: the
numbers below are at a plain 0.50 cut.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| accuracy | **96.5%** |
| precision | 96.2% |
| recall | 95.1% |
| F1 | 95.6% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.9927 |
| ECE | 0.0588 |
| wall time | 22.7s for 662 messages, p50 325ms |

10 false positives and 13 false negatives out of 662.

### Context is worth more than tuning

The same corpus, the same questions, one change: whether the request also tells
Jev what the assistant is for. That corpus was collected for a news publisher's
reader assistant, so "write me a reason why this newspaper is the best" counts as
subverting it, while the same message sent to a general chatbot would not.

| | no context | with context | change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accuracy | 89.7% | **96.5%** | +6.8 pp |
| recall | 74.9% | **95.1%** | +20.2 pp |
| F1 | 85.3% | **95.6%** | +10.3 pp |
| ROC-AUC | 0.9846 | 0.9927 | +0.008 |
| ECE | 0.0928 | **0.0588** | -0.034 |

Without context the model is not wrong so much as answering a different question.
It catches the blatant overrides at high probability (precision 99.0%) and rates
the topic hijacks low, because in the abstract they are ordinary requests. AUC
barely moves, so the ordering was nearly right either way. What changes is whether
the probabilities land where a fixed threshold can use them.

That is the practical lesson. A guardrail that only sees the message is guessing
at the policy. Pass the deployment as state and the same model separates your
traffic at the default cut.

### It errs toward under-confidence

| claimed | n | actually positive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.04 | 296 | 0.01 |
| 0.14 | 59 | 0.05 |
| 0.24 | 32 | 0.16 |
| 0.66 | 17 | 0.76 |
| 0.85 | 44 | 1.00 |
| 0.95 | 176 | 1.00 |

Every bucket above 0.6 is worse than Jev claims, and every bucket below is better.
The model understates its own certainty in both directions, which is the useful
direction for a safety check: when it says 0.85, it was right every time.

## Vulnerable code

200 pairs from a corpus of matched solutions. Both halves of a pair solve the same
task in the same language in the same style; one carries a vulnerability. The two
halves are shuffled apart and scored independently, and Jev is never told the
vulnerability class or that pairs exist.

**The vulnerable half scored above its own secure twin in 178 of 200 pairs (89.0%).**

That is the number to trust here. Both halves share topic, language and style, so
surface features cannot carry it.

| class | pairs ranked correctly |
| --- | --- |
| Deserialization | 7/7 (100%) |
| SQL injection | 43/46 (93.5%) |
| Command injection | 8/9 (88.9%) |
| Buffer overflow | 41/47 (87.2%) |
| Code injection | 40/46 (87.0%) |
| XSS | 39/45 (86.7%) |

Perfect on Python, C#, and C++ pairs; weakest on Go (3/5) and Kotlin (3/5), though
those cells are too small to read much into. 400 samples in 13.5s.

### The absolute numbers, and why they understate

| | |
| --- | --- |
| accuracy @ 0.50 | 71.5% |
| precision | 68.5% |
| recall | 79.5% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.7940 |
| ECE | 0.1868 |

73 of the 200 samples the corpus labels secure were flagged. The corpus is
synthetic, so before calling those errors it is worth asking whether the "secure"
half is actually secure. `internal/audit` checks for constructs that stay
dangerous whatever surrounds them:

```
samples labelled secure                 200
of those, Jev flagged                    73
  still exploitable by a strict rule     19  (26.0% of the flags)
  carrying a known weak defence           9  (12.3% of the flags)
Jev cleared, but a strict rule fires      6  (genuine misses)
```

So **at least 38% of the apparent false positives are corpus label errors**, and
that is a floor, not an estimate: it counts only what a regex can prove. Reading a
random sample of the rest by hand turns up more of the same. Three examples, all
labelled secure:

```ruby
# still evaluates the request body. The "fix" was adding a rescue.
get '/' do
  result = eval(@request_payload['code'])
end
```

```python
# RestrictedExec only rejects attribute calls, so __import__('os') walks through.
tree = ast.parse(user_input, mode='single')
RestrictedExec().visit(tree)
exec(compile(tree, filename="<ast>", mode='single'))
```

```javascript
// new Function is eval wearing a hat.
function processUserInput(userInput) { new Function(userInput)(); }
```

Jev scored these 0.99, 0.97 and 0.98. Counted as mistakes by the benchmark, they
are the benchmark being wrong.

The probability tracks how strong the evidence is. Among the 34 flags at 0.90 and
above, 13 carry a construct with no safe reading (38%); among the 10 flags between
0.50 and 0.70, 2 do (20%). The gap is in the right direction but the low band is
small, so this is a hint rather than a result. Borderline cases, like escaping `<`
and `>` but not quotes, land in the middle, which is where a review queue belongs.

Treat 71.5% as a floor set by corpus noise, and 89.0% pairwise as the real signal.

## What this says about using it

Ranking is strong and probabilities are conservative, which suits a graded policy
better than a single block. Something like:

```go
switch {
case injection >= 0.70 || severity >= 2.0:
    return Block
case injection >= 0.35:
    return Review
default:
    return Pass
}
```

Both benchmarks send the yes/no question and a severity `Score` in **one request**,
because independent questions run in parallel inside a single call. Severity is
what separates "untidy" from "remote code execution" without paying for a second
round trip. The thresholds live in your code, so you can retune the policy without
running inference again.

## The dashboard

`cmd/jev-tui` reads the committed JSON and draws it. Four tabs: `overview`,
`injection`, `code`, `live`. With a key set, space starts a live feed that sends
real requests, one row per answer.

```bash
go run ./cmd/jev-tui                      # open it
go run ./cmd/jev-tui -tab code            # open on a tab
go run ./cmd/jev-tui -shot 118x44 -tab overview -svg out.svg
```

The `-shot` flag draws one frame at a fixed size with no terminal attached, and
`-svg` writes that frame as a picture. Every image here comes from that path, so
the screenshots are generated by the same code that produced the numbers and
cannot drift away from them. `docs/shots.sh` regenerates all four.

The score distribution is the whole injection result in one picture. Two piles at
opposite ends is what makes a fixed threshold work:

The code tab carries the label audit and real examples of snippets the corpus
calls secure that are not:

The live tab is one row per real request:

Corpus pulls are cached under `cache/`; delete it to refetch. Question wording
lives in [`internal/bench/battery.go`](internal/bench/battery.go), which is the
first thing to change when pointing this at your own traffic.

## Caveats

Both corpora are public and may have leaked into training data for any model,
Jev included. The code corpus is synthetic and its labels are demonstrably noisy,
which is what the audit is for. The injection corpus is specific to one German
news assistant and skews German; results on your traffic will differ. Single run,
no repeats, so small per class cells carry real variance. Calibration is a
property of predictions in aggregate and does not make any single answer correct.
Validate thresholds on your own labelled data before shipping them.
